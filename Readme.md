## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burraksumer/burakMulayim/master/public/websiteScreenshot.png)

This website is a showcase of my passion for technology. It was built with Astro, a fast and simple static site generator, and TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

The website runs serverlessly using edge, making it fast, secure, and scalable. It is also customizable, giving you the flexibility to make it your own. The blog section is powered by Markdown file-based blogging, making it easy for me to update and manage my content.

To ensure a smooth and seamless experience, I have also integrated CI/CD into the development process. This means that every change I make is automatically built and deployed, ensuring that the site is always up-to-date.

I hope you enjoy exploring my personal website and learn more about me and my work. Thank you for visiting!

## Built With

- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.dev/)

## Getting Started

This can be used a template to your website. You don't need to link me although if you did I'd feel good.

### Prerequisites

I recommend:

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

- npm = 17.x

```sh
nvm install 17.x
```

Although this was developed with npm@latest if you want to deploy to Cloudflare Pages you'd be stuck with npm@17.x since Cloudflare doesn't yet have support for this.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/burraksumer/burakMulayim.git
```

3. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

4. Start changing things
